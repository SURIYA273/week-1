# 🔋 Electric Vehicle (EV) Data Analysis & Insights
### 🧠 Week-1: AI/ML Internship Project  

## 📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing, cleaning, and deriving insights from electric vehicle (EV) datasets to understand performance trends, specifications, and market patterns in the growing EV industry.  
Raw data often contains inconsistencies, missing values, or unstructured information — this project transforms that raw data into actionable insights through data preprocessing, visualization, and exploratory analysis.

## ⚙️ Key Features

### 🔹 EV Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and structured raw dataset for consistency.  
- Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers.  
- Standardized data formats for better analysis.

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized EV performance trends using graphs and charts.  
- Identified top manufacturers and vehicle categories.  
- Compared factors such as range, cost, and charging efficiency.  
- Derived insights into adoption trends and market distribution.

### 🔹 Future Scope
- Build ML models for predicting EV range, cost, or efficiency.  
- Develop dashboards to visualize EV growth over time.  
- Integrate real-time EV market data for live analytics.
